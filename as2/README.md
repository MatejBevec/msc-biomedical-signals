# Assignment 1: Canny Edge Detector

Implementation of the Canny edge detector for the task of organ contour detection from computed tomography (CT) images.

![Input images and detected contours (after edge linking)](/figs/examples.png)


## Usage

Experimental code with all figures is available as a jupyter notebook in `as2.ipynb`.

Or run the detector as a commandline tool. The detected edges will be saved as an image with the same name.
```
./canny.py [path_to_image]
```

See `report.pdf` for implementation and evaluation details.
